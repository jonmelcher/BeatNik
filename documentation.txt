#########   This project is intended to serve to help both the
# GOALS #   collaborators in improve at coding in general as
#########   well as coding cooperatively, and to help develop
the skills necessary to organize, develop, and to publish a
finished product.  We are both new to programming and any and
all comments on the code should please be directed to on of our
e-mails, we would be happy to read it!

#########   In this section we will list all classes/methods
# FILES #   available within each file, as well as the file
#########   dependencies.

music.py    - Playlist Class
            - Song     Class
            - ...

scraper.py  - This file uses music.py as a module.
            - BPMDB    Class
            - AudioKC  Class

...

##############  In this section we will describe the class, and
# SCRAPER.PY #  expand on the methods for the classes found in
##############  scraper.py.

class BPMDB()   - This class has is not instantiated; all methods
                  within are static.  In this respect its class
                  serves only to keep the methods together.  The
                  methods are as follows:

url_helper(begin, gate, ending)
-   This is a helper function used later in the functions band_grab
    and letter_grab.  Its purpose is to shift some of the numerical
    values found in urls (begin=x, num=y, etc.) and return the new
    url.  With respect to the functions it helps, it updates the url
    they are using for the next single-page parse call.

    Type:   Int -> Bool -> String -> String

    Example:
    BPMDB.url_helper(10, True, 'Radiohead') returns
    "http://www.bpmdatabase.com/browse.php?begin=10&artist=Radiohead"

raw_table_grab(url)
-   This is a helper function used later in the functions artist_parse
    and song_parse.  Its purpose is to take the HTML source from the
    url argument and find the line containing the pertinent information,
    and return it as a string.  With respect to the functions it helps,
    it does most of the grunt work, allowing the latter functions to
    pattern match more accurately and easily.

    Type:   String -> String

    Example:
    BPMDB.raw_table_grab('http://www.bpmdatabase.com/browse.php?begin=0&num=1&artist=Radiohead')
    returns "...<td>Radiohead</td><td>Fake Plastic Trees</td><td></td><td>74 BPM</td><td></td><td>Capitol Records</td>..."

artist_parse(url)
-   This is a main method which uses raw_table_grab on url, and regex
    pattern matching to return a list of artists.

    Type:   String -> [String]

    Example:
    BPMDB.artist_parse('http://www.bpmdatabase.com/browse.php?letter=3')
    returns ['3+Days+Grace', '3+Doors+Down', '3+Jays', '3+Phase+Featuring+Dr.+Motte', '3-Day+Threshold', '311', '3OH%213']

song_parse(url)
-   This is a main method which uses raw_table_grab on url, and regex
    pattern matching to return a list of lists of song data.

    Type:   String -> [[String]]

    Example:
    BPMDB.song_parse('http://www.bpmdatabase.com/browse.php?artist=3+Days+Grace')
    returns [['3 Days Grace', 'Home', 'NULL', '84 BPM', 'NULL', 'NULL', 'NULL'], ['3 Days Grace', 'Everything About You', 'NULL', '89 BPM', 'NULL', 'NULL', 'NULL'], ['3 Days Grace', 'Animal I Have Become', 'NULL', '120 BPM', 'NULL', 'NULL', '2006']]

band_grab(bandname)
-   This is a main method which scrapes all songs by the bandname on the website.
    It uses both url_helper and song_parse.  band_grab also contains the method
    to write to the scrapelog.text file.  band_grab calls song_parse as many times
    as necessary, and then uses the data to initialize and return a list of Song
    objects.

    Type:   String -> [Song]

    Example:
    See song_parse and Song Class for more information.
    band_grab('Radiohead') = [ Song([Corresponding list from song_parse]) ]

band_multi_grab(bandlist)
-   This is a main method which takes a list of bandnames and calls and combines results
    from band_grab.

    Type:   [String] -> [Song]

    Example:
    See band_grab for more information.

letter_grab(value)
-   This is a main function which will scrape all artist names which start with
    the given value.  It uses url_helper as well as artist_parse to do this.

    Type:   Char -> [String]

    Example:
    BPMDB.letter_grab('3') returns
    ['3+Days+Grace', '3+Doors+Down', '3+Jays', '3+Phase+Featuring+Dr.+Motte', '3-Day+Threshold', '311', '3OH%213']

crawl()
-   This is the method the class was designed for, it combines all other methods to scrape
    every artist starting with characters found by iterating over alphanumeric variable, and
    then scrapes all songs by said artists.  This writes all of the activity to scrapelog.txt
    and returns a combined list of all the songs scraped.

    Type:   Void -> [Song]
